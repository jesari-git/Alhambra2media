This sources includes the design of a shield (or hat) that provides the Alhambra-II FPGA board with:

    A VGA interface with 64 colors. A clone of the already available AP-VGA
    An audio input to an on-board sigma delta modulator
    A low-pass filtered audio output
    Either:
        An USB connector with pull-up / pull-downs resistors
        A PS2 keyboard / mouse connector with 5V to 3.3V conversion
    A micro-SD card connector
    An on-board PSRAM memory with QSPI interface
